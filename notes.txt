THOUGHTS
the bash-python 'embedding' is pretty awkward, especially because i 
have two scripts that do different things but where one calls the 
other. 
python is really useful for the socket handling, but if i could find 
a way to do that in bash it would be perfect.
actually the main problem here is that the socket script should be 
the 'master' over the getter script, because new data should be
collected every time a socket connection is made. so this needs fixing.
